## My Journey
Born and raised in Rwanda, I discovered an early fascination with electronics and communication technologies. I began cultivating hands-on expertise through professional training in fiber-optic installation and troubleshooting, which gave me a practical foundation in connectivity systems.

I went on to earn my Bachelor of sciencewith honors in Information Technology from the University of Rwanda, College of Science and Technology. Building on this academic and technical base, I am now advancing my skills in embedded systems and IoT—focusing on the integration of electronics, communication, and smart connected devices. My journey is driven by a commitment to transforming theoretical knowledge into practical, real-world applications that improve everyday life and empower communities
