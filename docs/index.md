## 📋 HSP-PCB Project Overview

This documentation site records **Ernest Nkunzimana's comprehensive digital fabrication journey** designing and prototyping the **Human-Sovereign Privacy & Security PCB (HSP-PCB)** — a hardware-level solution to restore trust in digital systems through:

- **Verifiable hardware design** with transparent threat modeling
- **Tamper detection & secure enclosure** design
- **Modular, repairable architecture** for IoT ecosystems
- **Privacy-first cryptographic infrastructure** for asset management
- **Complete design-to-fabrication workflow** documentation

### 🎯 Why HSP-PCB Matters

**The Problem:** Digital trust has collapsed. Manufacturers, cloud providers, and telecoms have demonstrated systemic disregard for human privacy and autonomy. Citizens lack verifiable, trustworthy hardware to reclaim control.

**The Solution:** HSP-PCB provides a **physical, auditable, repairable foundation** for privacy-first IoT systems—designed to be:
- **Verifiable** - All schematics, layouts, and source code open for inspection
- **Recoverable** - Designed for long-term repairability and community maintenance
- **Modular** - Plug-and-play integration into vehicles, homes, and portable devices
- **Sustainable** - Minimal electronic waste, maximum lifecycle value

## My Journey
Born and raised in Rwanda, I discovered an early fascination with electronics and communication technologies. I began cultivating hands-on expertise through professional training in fiber-optic installation and troubleshooting, which gave me a practical foundation in connectivity systems.

I went on to earn my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Rwanda, College of Science and Technology (School of Engineering). Building on this academic and technical base, I am now advancing my skills in embedded systems and IoT—focusing on the integration of electronics, communication, and smart connected devices. My journey is driven by a commitment to transforming theoretical knowledge into practical, real-world applications that improve everyday life and empower communities
